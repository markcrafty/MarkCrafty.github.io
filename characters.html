					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Alacard is unlike the rest of his kind. They are ruthless killers, wanting nothing but to siphon power.<br>
						He was made an offer to join the Void Peddlers, a group of deserters like him, but declined.<br>
						He instead went around the world, meeting new people and visiting new locations.<br>
						In Nelvia, he made a bond with a girl named Toka, who shared his love of advanced weaponry.<br>
						After a while, it became a habit for him to check in on her, as she had no family of her own.<br>
						<br>
						All was well, until the day Paraxim assaulted the city.<br>
						<br>
						His forces took the city, destroying everything outside the main walls.<br>
						Alacard returned during the siege. In a blind rage, he slaughtered Paraxim's forces and his advisor, Kazhix.<br>
						Toka's survival may be uncertain, but one thing is: Alacard will not stop hunting Paraxim until he knows what happened to her.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Weapon: Twin Pistols<br>
						<br>
						Wildfire Grenade:<br>

						Rapid Fire:<br>
						Deal 2x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) to an enemy 5 times. You can select all enemies, causing the damage to be split evenly among them.<br>
						<br>
						Master Huntsman:<br>

						<br>
						Interdiction Rifle:<br>
						Heroic: Alacard brings out his most powerful gun, the Interdiction Rifle. It can shoot 3 specialized bolts before overheating. These bolts deal 6x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) and ignore Armor.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Trivia</h2>

						<br>
						Alacard's name is very similar to Alucard, who I didn't know existed during his creation.<br>

					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Vynfall was once Camellia's home, back when it was known as Forest's Edge.<br>
						Vyn's original defeat came with a curse: The area was diseased and darkened, and his soul was forever locked beneath the earth.<br>
						All who lived there had left to find new homes, but during a survey of the damage, a mage deserted her party to try and harness Vyn's soul. Her attempts failed, but she would always try again.<br>
						Many years later, Camellia returned to her past home to see if she could find any of her family's belongings. During this time, she found the mage. But she was too late to stop her.<br>
						Vyn suddenly sprung to life<br>
						His rise came with the mage fleeing, and him wounding Camellia with a shadowy scythe just before she escaped.<br>
						<br>
						While Vyn had returned, he was tied to his resting place, only able to be a commander to his master's armies.<br>
						Now, Camellia waits in Ephilar for adventurers brave enough to help her take down Vyn once and for all.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>

					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Neraz was once one of the 4 Generals of Voragon's army.<br>
						He was a masterful swordsman, and had fought in many wars before his life was claimed by Paraxim.<br>
						After years of being controlled, Voragon's grip began to weaken. He plotted in secret to escape his dark masters.<br>
						When the time was right, he made his move. He caused a storm of frost and blood to crash upon the citadel.<br>
						But, Neraz was not the only one who fled.<br>
						Many of Voragon's minions deserted alongside him, even another general: Zivian.<br>
						Voragon, in a furious rage, sent Nocturnus after Zivian, while he had Paraxim hunt down Neraz and the deserters.<br>
						Neraz eventually arrived in a small forest town called Nelvia, and stayed there for 3 years.<br>
						As time passed, the city grew, and his faction had become allies of the Nekim.<br>
						<br>
						Neraz has been awaiting the day Paraxim finds him.<br>
						He was eager to kill a general.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Weapon: Sword<br>
						<br>
						Northern Blade:<br>
						Neraz's blade freezes over, causing his next 3 Basic Attacks to deal +20% damage and decrease the target's Speed by 20% for 3 turns. (If the target is Bleeding, gain Taste of Blood, increase this skill's bonus by 20%, and refresh the remaining charges.)<br>

						<br>

						<br>
						Life Conduit:<br>
						Heroic: Neraz infuses a conduit of blood into an ally, causing their next 3 attacks to deal 2x Neraz's Strength damage to their target, and heal for the same amount. (Another random ally gains the conduit if Neraz has Taste of Blood.)<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Trivia</h2>
					<p>
						Neraz released in the very first patch, making him one of the 8 oldest characters.<br>
						<br>
						Neraz replaced a character codenamed "Quickblade", and was originally designed on a car ride.<br>
						<br>
						Neraz used to summon undead, but was redesigned due to the system being buggy.<br>

						<br>
						Sel, with her newfound toxic weapons, returned to her original mission.<br>

					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Jade always looked up to those who defended her home city, Skyfold.<br>
						So, it came as no surprise that she began training to become like them.<br>
						Eventually, Jade was the first female guard of the city, and protected it like it was her own child.<br>
						<br>
						But then, Magmardon errupted.<br>
						The slumbering mountain had grown volatile from the fire elementals living within, and now they were unleashed on Desolin and it's cities.<br>
						Jade was there to help evacuate Skyfold, and even wounded a general of flame.<br>
						<br>
						While not everyone escaped, she did what she could, and hoped the others could make it out too...<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						<br>
						...Jade's story continues. The city of Eldan was home to many plagues and curses, one of which was Sanguara.<br>
						Jade, and 3 others, used the amulets they wielded to seal Sanguara beneath the city.<br>
						They built 4 additional seals around Ephilon to ensure she could not escape...but her influence has spread to a major trade company known as Visionary.<br>
