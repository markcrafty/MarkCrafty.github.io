					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Alacard is unlike the rest of his kind. They are ruthless killers, wanting nothing but to siphon power.<br>
						He was made an offer to join the Void Peddlers, a group of deserters like him, but declined.<br>
						He instead went around the world, meeting new people and visiting new locations.<br>
						In Nelvia, he made a bond with a girl named Toka, who shared his love of advanced weaponry.<br>
						After a while, it became a habit for him to check in on her, as she had no family of her own.<br>
						<br>
						All was well, until the day Paraxim assaulted the city.<br>
						<br>
						His forces took the city, destroying everything outside the main walls.<br>
						Alacard returned during the siege. In a blind rage, he slaughtered Paraxim's forces and his advisor, Kazhix.<br>
						Toka's survival may be uncertain, but one thing is: Alacard will not stop hunting Paraxim until he knows what happened to her.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Weapon: Twin Pistols<br>
						<br>
						Wildfire Grenade:<br>
						Deal 4x Strength damage (Elements: Fire) to an enemy. If the target is above 70% health, apply Burn and deal 100% more damage. If the target is already affected by Burn, Critically Strike.<br>
						<br>
						Rapid Fire:<br>
						Deal 2x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) to an enemy 5 times. You can select all enemies, causing the damage to be split evenly among them.<br>
						<br>
						Master Huntsman:<br>
						Passive: Alacard's attacks can bypass Taunt. Gunmaster: Switch between Dual Shot and Quickshot at will (Dual Shot damages 2 different enemies, Quickshot deals higher damage to 1).<br>
						<br>
						Interdiction Rifle:<br>
						Heroic: Alacard brings out his most powerful gun, the Interdiction Rifle. It can shoot 3 specialized bolts before overheating. These bolts deal 6x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) and ignore Armor.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Extra Info</h2>
					<p>
						Alacard released in <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/ephilar_tom/303924/devlog/0-2-0-edge-of-reality-patch-notes-8wtjccjt">Patch 0.2.0: Edge of Reality</a>, alongside the dungeon by the same name.<br>
						<br>
						Alacard's name is very similar to Alucard, who I didn't know existed during his creation.<br>
						<br>
						Alacard had a fanclub in 0.3.2, all the way up to 0.7.0.<br>

				<div>
					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Vynfall was once Camellia's home, back when it was known as Forest's Edge.<br>
						Vyn's original defeat came with a curse: The area was diseased and darkened, and his soul was forever locked beneath the earth.<br>
						All who lived there had left to find new homes, but during a survey of the damage, a mage deserted her party to try and harness Vyn's soul. Her attempts failed, but she would always try again.<br>
						Many years later, Camellia returned to her past home to see if she could find any of her family's belongings. During this time, she found the mage. But she was too late to stop her.<br>
						Vyn suddenly sprung to life<br>
						His rise came with the mage fleeing, and him wounding Camellia with a shadowy scythe just before she escaped.<br>
						<br>
						While Vyn had returned, he was tied to his resting place, only able to be a commander to his master's armies.<br>
						Now, Camellia waits in Ephilar for adventurers brave enough to help her take down Vyn once and for all.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Weapon: Bayonet<br>
						<br>
						Close Combat:<br>
						Deal 2x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) to an enemy twice, then lower their Physical Armor by 50% (For 2 turns) and strike again.<br>
						<br>
						Blade Dance:<br>
						Deal 3x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) to 2 different enemies. If any are Stunned, Critically Strike.<br>
						<br>
						Perfect Parry:<br>
						Passive: Camellia has a 10% chance to perform Perfect Parry (Deal 4x Strength damage (Elements: Physical) and apply Stun for 2 turns) after taking Physical damage.<br>
						<br>
						Tiny Camellia:<br>
						Heroic: Camellia summons a tiny version of herself to deal 4x Strength damage (Elements: Physical, Fire) to all enemies. She then applies Bleed to them.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Extra Info</h2>
					<p>
						Camellia released in <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/ephilar_tom/303924/devlog/patch-0-8-0-leylight-hollow-again-3xceye45">Patch 0.8.0: Leylight Hollow</a>, alongside Rayzon and the Jelly Overgrowth's redesigns.<br>
						<br>
						Camellia was planned for about a month before finally releasing due to no work being done on her face sprite.<br>
						<br>
						Camellia was created entirely by <a href="https://twitter.com/Xelynaria">Xelynaria</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/FanStalin">FanStalin</a>.<br>

				<div>
					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Neraz was once one of the 4 Generals of Voragon's army.<br>
						He was a masterful swordsman, and had fought in many wars before his life was claimed by Paraxim.<br>
						After years of being controlled, Voragon's grip began to weaken. He plotted in secret to escape his dark masters.<br>
						When the time was right, he made his move. He caused a storm of frost and blood to crash upon the citadel.<br>
						But, Neraz was not the only one who fled.<br>
						Many of Voragon's minions deserted alongside him, even another general: Zivian.<br>
						Voragon, in a furious rage, sent Nocturnus after Zivian, while he had Paraxim hunt down Neraz and the deserters.<br>
						Neraz eventually arrived in a small forest town called Nelvia, and stayed there for 3 years.<br>
						As time passed, the city grew, and his faction had become allies of the Nekim.<br>
						<br>
						Neraz has been awaiting the day Paraxim finds him.<br>
						He was eager to kill a general.<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Skills</h2>
					<p>
						Weapon: Sword<br>
						<br>
						Northern Blade:<br>
						Neraz's blade freezes over, causing his next 3 Basic Attacks to deal +20% damage and decrease the target's Speed by 20% for 3 turns. (If the target is Bleeding, gain Taste of Blood, increase this skill's bonus by 20%, and refresh the remaining charges.)<br>
						<br>
						Frozen Strike:<br>
						Deals 4x Strength damage (Elements: Frost) to an enemy and apply Slowness to them. (Also apply Deep Wounds if Neraz has Taste of Blood.)<br>
						<br>
						Lich's Shield:<br>
						Passive: Neraz's Basic Attacks generate a Shield equal to the damage they deal, but cost 5% of his Max HP. (The target pays the price if Neraz has Taste of Blood.)<br>
						<br>
						Life Conduit:<br>
						Heroic: Neraz infuses a conduit of blood into an ally, causing their next 3 attacks to deal 2x Neraz's Strength damage to their target, and heal for the same amount. (Another random ally gains the conduit if Neraz has Taste of Blood.)<br>
					</p>
					<h2>Extra Info</h2>
					<p>
						Neraz released in the very first patch, making him one of the 8 oldest characters.<br>
						<br>
						Neraz replaced a character codenamed "Quickblade", and was originally designed on a car ride.<br>
						<br>
						Neraz used to summon undead, but was redesigned due to the system being buggy.<br>

					<h2>Bio</h2>
					<p>
						Sel, unlike the rest of her people, disliked conflict with the other humanoid races of Ephilon.<br>
						She much prefered joining the Void Peddlers, a neutral faction of Void Elves, who exist to make a profit.<br>
						During her time working with them, she accepted missions to gather supplies and kill deadly creatures.<br>
						On one such mission, she came accross the hut of an alchemist named Daxt, who decided to show her some of his Toxins.<br>
						They eventually decided to strike a deal: Daxt supplies Sel with Toxins, and she would deliver him gold each week.<br>
						<br>
						Sel, with her newfound toxic weapons, returned to her original mission.<br>
						Her and Daxt kept up their trade for weeks, until Xelni decided to teach Sel about making them herself.<br>
						Relations between the Peddlers and Daxt were damaged when he learned about this, but he didn't hold his grudges for long.<br>
						<br>
						Now, Sel continues her missions. But, a curious adventurer arrived recently...Hyria. And Sel wants to get to know her.<br>
					</p>
